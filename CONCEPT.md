The idea
-----------
The concept of this program is to provide arrangers with software that turns arranging a Free-for-all style osu competition into a simple thing.

In the past, if every player was playing against each other, the arrangers would have to manually enter numbers, leaving a risk of mistyping. This program aims at automating that process, as well as supporting normalization of scores, and even a GUI to overlay during breaks during a livestream, where scores can be shown.
